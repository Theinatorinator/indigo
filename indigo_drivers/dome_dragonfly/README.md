* This driver can not be loaded if *indigo_rotator_lunatico* is loaded as both drivers have the same functionality. The only difference is that "Main" port of *indigo_rotator_lunatico* driver is configured as Rotator.

* In devices with male DB9 connectors, pins are horizontally flipped. In software pin 1 corresponds to pin 5 on male DB9, pin 6 corresponds to pin 9 etc. There is no such flipping for the devices with female DB9 connectors.
