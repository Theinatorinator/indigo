https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com

## Supported devices

All ZWO EAF focusers.

This driver supports hot-plug (multiple devices).

## Supported platforms

This driver depends on 3rd party library and is supported on Linux (Intel 32/64 bit and ARM v6+) and MacOS.

## License

INDIGO Astronomy open-source license (3rd party library is closed source).

## Use

indigo_server indigo_focuser_asi

## Status: Stable

Driver is developed and tested with:
* ASI EAF

## NOTE! MacOS users only.

If your Mac does not recognize the attached EAF and you see message like this:

`22:03:49.250247 indigo_server: indigo_focuser_asi[process_plug_event:707, 0x70000276c000]: No plugged device found.`

Please follow these steps:

1. Connect the power to EAF.
2. Connect the EAF to your Mac via USB cable.
3. Power OFF and then power ON your Mac.
4. The EAF should be discovered -> `indigo_focuser_asi: 'EAF #0' attached`

This seems to be a MacOS issue. Looks like this procedure fixes some device permissions.
This procedure should be followed only once, then your EAF should be auto discovered.
